# PLSQL-challenge
# Objectives
This project focuses on practicing PL/SQL in the context of a transaction processing system. You will create and initialize tables, write PL/SQL functions and triggers, and handle exceptions. The tasks involve updating employee records, processing transactions, and ensuring data integrity through comprehensive error handling and logging.

# Key Tasks
Table Creation: Create and initialize EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT, TRANSACTION, and SALARY_LIST tables.
PL/SQL Function: Develop a function to process transactions from the TRANSACTION table with robust exception handling.
Triggers: Implement triggers to log changes and print records upon updates and insertions.
Function Execution: Execute the PL/SQL function with sample data and demonstrate its operations.
Exception Handling: Create test cases to demonstrate the handling of various exceptional conditions.
This project aims to enhance your skills in database management, PL/SQL programming, and transaction handling.
